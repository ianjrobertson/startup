In this deliverable, I created the skeleton of my startup webpage. I created a landing page with a header and login. I added navigation and pages for all the different elements of the page. 

I implemented the basic design of my webpage I created for the first deliverable. My websocket will be implemeted by a notifications page. My database will hold persistent data for the posts and userinfo. I will use a third party map API to handle location logic.
